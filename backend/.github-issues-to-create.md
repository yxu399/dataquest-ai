# GitHub Issues to Create

## Issue 1: Technical Debt - Fix Ruff Linting Errors

**Title:** Technical Debt: Fix outstanding Ruff linting errors

**Labels:** technical-debt, code-quality

**Description:**
The CI pipeline currently has `continue-on-error: true` for Ruff linting checks. We need to fix all existing linting violations so we can enforce strict linting on all future commits.

### Current violations:
Run locally to get the list:
```bash
cd backend
uv run ruff check .
```

### Action items:
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff check .` to get full list of violations
- [ ] Fix all violations or add `# noqa: <error-code>` with justification for exceptions
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` (lint step)
- [ ] Verify CI passes with strict linting

### Priority: Medium
**Why fix this:** Prevents new linting errors from being introduced while maintaining code quality standards.

## Issue 2: Technical Debt - Fix Ruff Formatting Issues

**Title:** Technical Debt: Fix Ruff formatting inconsistencies

**Labels:** technical-debt, code-quality

**Description:**
Code formatting checks are currently lenient. We should format all existing code and enforce strict formatting on future commits.

### Action items:
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff format .` to auto-format all code
- [ ] Review and commit formatting changes
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` (format check step)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hook for automatic formatting (optional)

### Priority: Low
**Why fix this:** Consistent formatting improves readability and reduces merge conflicts.

## Issue 3: Technical Debt - Fix mypy Type Checking Errors

**Title:** Technical Debt: Add type hints and fix mypy errors

**Labels:** technical-debt, type-safety

**Description:**
Type checking is currently lenient to allow gradual typing adoption. We should progressively add type hints and fix type errors.

### Current violations:
```bash
cd backend
uv run mypy app/ --ignore-missing-imports --show-error-codes
```

### Action items:
- [ ] Run mypy to get full list of type errors
- [ ] Add type hints to core modules (app/agents/, app/services/)
- [ ] Fix type errors or add `# type: ignore[error-code]` with justification
- [ ] Consider adding mypy to pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` (type-check step)

### Priority: Medium
**Why fix this:** Type hints catch bugs at development time and improve IDE autocomplete.

## Issue 4: Technical Debt - Review and Configure Safety Security Policy

**Title:** Create .safety-policy.yml for known vulnerability exceptions

**Labels:** technical-debt, security

**Description:**
Security scanning is currently lenient to avoid blocking on known, low-risk vulnerabilities in older dependencies.

### Action items:
- [ ] Run `uv run safety check` to see current vulnerabilities
- [ ] For each vulnerability:
  - [ ] Assess risk: Is it exploitable in our use case?
  - [ ] Update dependency if fix available
  - [ ] Add to `.safety-policy.yml` with justification if cannot update
- [ ] Document policy decisions in the policy file
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` (security step)

### Priority: High
**Why fix this:** Security vulnerabilities should block merges by default. Exceptions should be explicit and documented.

### Example .safety-policy.yml:
```yaml
security:
  ignore-vulnerabilities:
    # Example: CVE-2024-XXXXX in package==1.2.3
    # Reason: Not exploitable - we don't use the vulnerable function
    # Plan: Update when 1.3.0 is released (Q2 2024)
```

# Frontend Issues

## Issue 5: Technical Debt - Fix ESLint Errors

**Title:** Technical Debt: Fix outstanding ESLint errors in frontend

**Labels:** technical-debt, frontend, code-quality

**Description:**
The frontend CI pipeline currently has `continue-on-error: true` for ESLint checks. We need to fix all existing linting violations so we can enforce strict linting on all future commits.

### Current violations:
Run locally to get the list:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

### Action items:
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` to get full list of violations
- [ ] Fix all violations or add `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule>` with justification for exceptions
- [ ] Use `npm run lint -- --fix` to auto-fix simple issues
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` (lint step)
- [ ] Verify CI passes with strict linting

### Priority: Medium
**Why fix this:** Prevents new linting errors from being introduced while maintaining code quality standards.

## Issue 6: Technical Debt - Review and Fix npm Audit Vulnerabilities

**Title:** Fix npm audit vulnerabilities in frontend dependencies

**Labels:** technical-debt, frontend, security

**Description:**
Security scanning is currently lenient to avoid blocking on known, low-risk vulnerabilities in older dependencies.

### Action items:
- [ ] Run `npm audit` to see current vulnerabilities
- [ ] For each vulnerability:
  - [ ] Assess risk: Is it exploitable in our use case?
  - [ ] Update dependency if fix available: `npm update <package>`
  - [ ] Document exceptions if cannot update (e.g., waiting for upstream fix)
- [ ] Consider using `.npmrc` or package overrides for vetted exceptions
- [ ] Remove `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml` (security step)

### Priority: High
**Why fix this:** Security vulnerabilities should block merges by default. Exceptions should be explicit and documented.

## Instructions

### Backend Issues (1-4)
1. Create these 4 backend issues in your GitHub repository
2. Assign them to yourself or relevant team members
3. Prioritize: Security (High) → Linting/Type-checking (Medium) → Formatting (Low)
4. After fixing each issue, remove the corresponding `continue-on-error: true` from backend-ci.yml

### Frontend Issues (5-6)
1. Create these 2 frontend issues in your GitHub repository
2. Assign them to yourself or relevant team members
3. Prioritize: Security (High) → Linting (Medium)
4. After fixing each issue, remove the corresponding `continue-on-error: true` from frontend-ci.yml

This ensures the CI pipeline becomes progressively stricter while not blocking current development.
